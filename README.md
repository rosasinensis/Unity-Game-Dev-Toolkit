# Unity-Game-Dev-Toolkit
A collection of C# scripts and logic systems for Unity.

A private collection of scripts I've written for my games that I think are helpful for a variety of projects. Putting it up here so I can use it across my other projects, too!

<h2>Current Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Pick.cs</b>
<br>Utility. Supports weighted loot tables, Fisher-Yates shuffling, and seeded results. Works with Lists and Arrays.</li>
<li><b>DebugLogger.cs</b>
<br>Puts all UnityEngine.Debug.Logs into this DebugLogger, so it can be easily turned on or off for showing or logging. Also keeps all messages so it can be retrieved whenever.</li>
</ul>
